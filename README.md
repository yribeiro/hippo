## Pre-commit setup
Setting up the pre-commit library to run the pre-commit hooks whenever you commit your code is done as follows:
1. To setup pre-commit to run using poetry run the command :
        *'poetry run pre-commit install'
2. If you want to run the pre-commit checks manually run the command:
        *'poetry run pre-commit run --all-files'
